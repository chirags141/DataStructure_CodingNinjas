Return subset of an array
Send Feedback
Given an integer array (of length n), find and return all the subsets of input array.
Subsets are of length varying from 0 to n, that contain elements of the array. But the order of elements should remain same as in the input array.
Note : The order of subsets are not important.
Input format :

Line 1 : Size of array

Line 2 : Array elements (separated by space)

Sample Input:
3
15 20 12
Sample Output:
[] (this just represents an empty array, don't worry about the square brackets)
12
20
20 12
15
15 12
15 20
15 20 12
