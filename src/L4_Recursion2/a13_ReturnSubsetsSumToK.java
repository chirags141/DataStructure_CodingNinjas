Return subsets sum to K
Send Feedback
Given an array A of size n and an integer K, return all subsets of A which sum to K.
Subsets are of length varying from 0 to n, that contain elements of the array. But the order of elements should remain same as in the input array.
Note : The order of subsets are not important.
Input format :
Line 1 : Integer n, Size of input array
Line 2 : Array elements separated by space
Line 3 : K
Constraints :
1 <= n <= 20
Sample Input :
9
5 12 3 17 1 18 15 3 17
6
Sample Output :
3 3
5 1
